            </br></br>Climate change is now considered to be one of the greatest threats to global health of the 21st Century. Major threats to global health, both direct and indirect, from climate change include; changing patterns of disease, water and food insecurity, vulnerable shelter and human settlements, extreme climatic events, population growth and migration (Costello, et al., 2009). These threats will affect the lives of billions of people for several decades to come. Although research in this field is now on the rise, in comparison to other areas, this field remains largely undeveloped. From the early 1990’s to the mid 2000’s, the average annual number of articles published in PubMed-indexed journals that referred to “health” and either “climate change” or “global warming” more than doubled. However, over the same period, more than eight times as many articles referred to “health” and “air pollution”, and over 40 times more referred to “health” and “smoking” (Cambell-Lendrum, et al., 2009). Today’s world faces a global health crisis with the divide between the rich and poor is becoming ever greater. Approximately 800 million people go to sleep hungry every night with 1.5 billion not having access to a clean water supply. Climate change is predicted to have the most substantial indirect effect on global health as it will impact water, food and extreme climactic changes.
			</br></br>The list of health issues affected by climate change may be longer than many people expect including; asthma, respiratory allergies, airway diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, strokes, foodborne diseases, nutrition, heat-related morbidity and mortality, human developmental effects, mental health, stress-related disorders and more.  For example, focusing on asthma as, some experts speculated that the global rise in asthma was indirectly related to climate change (D'amato, 2008). Furthermore, there are high chances climate change will impact airway diseases as it increases ground level ozone and concentrations of fine particles. Exposure to ground-level ozone can reduce lung function and inflame the pleura linings of the lungs; repeated exposure may permanently scar lung tissue (Uysal, 2003). Another concern is mould spores which is an allergen affected by precipitation, may potentially be on the rise as 5% of individuals are predicted to have some respiratory allergic airway symptoms from mould over their lifetime (Hardin, 2003).
			</br></br>The resultant weather caused by climate change can also have a major impact on human health. On average, mortality levels increase between 1-4% per one degree rise in temperature, higher temperatures also increase the growth rate of food bacteria such as salmonella (Kovats, 2006). Another weather-related health issue is flooding.  Coastal flooding will threaten up to 1.6 million additional people per year in the EU (IPCC 2007) (WHO, 2008). For example, extreme weather events hit the United Kingdom (UK) in 2007 with extreme flooding floods and in 2003 with the heatwave of 2003. In 2007 major parts of the UK were hit by severe floods after unpredictably high levels of rainfall that resulted in 13 deaths and £3 billion pounds worth of damage to the UK infrastructure and the economy. During the summer of 2003, a heatwave with temperatures as high as 38 degrees Celsius hit the UK and Europe. This led to the death of more than 2000 people across England and Wales. (Vardoulakis & Heaviside, 2012). These are both strong examples of the effect weather can have on the health and wellbeing of individuals and the world. The detection and measurement of health effects related to climate change are essential to provide necessary evidence required to form national and international policies relating to control and mitigation measures (Wilson, et al., n.d.).
